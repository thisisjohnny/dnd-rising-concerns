# A simple task turns out to be not so simple
What happens when five young dwarves graduate from training and leave the citadel on a mission to secure safe passage for a barmaid? Nothing they ever expected.

## The gang
- **Jogranam**: _A bard, a brigand, a best mate._
  - Joggy, as his mates call him, is the rather rash and outspoken mouthpiece for the group. His cutting words often find him in a spot of trouble or wiggling his way out of it.
- **Travok**: _A rogue with a shiny cape and shinier bald head._
  - Travok blends silk and steel, quite literally, to help the group out of the toughest situations—or to peck a fight.
- **Artina**: _A cleric with a soft spot for trolls._
  - Artina may be soft-spoken, but her piety makes her a powerful conduit for the gods and both their healing and destructive powers.
- **Berend**: _A raw ass fighter with a penchant for debauchery._
  - Berend likes three things most in this world: his women, his brews, and liberally applying sharp steel to his enemies' skulls.
- **Vondal**: _A woke AF paladin._
  - Vondal "The Woke" spreads his message of equality across the land using equal parts charisma and brutal, divine justice.

## GFOGs – Good friends of the gang
- **Klug**
- **Talon Greenthorn**
- **Dain Fireforge**
