# Into the Hellmouth

## On the other side of the door
On the other side of the door, the gang finds a spiraling staircase headed down even farther below the manor
  - Once through the door, the plate opened up producing the egg necklace on the other side back in its previous state with jumbled features
  - Travok flourished his cape and walked down the steps, confidently if not stealthily
    - Trav returned upstairs a short moment later to join back up with the party and report what he had seen and heard: there were three passages diverging in a pitch-black cave, and the sound of a horrible monster (presumably) tearing a person to pieces
  - The gang headed back down the spiral stairs in an almost clumsy manner due to the uneven nature of the stone carved staircase
    - Talon decided to scout out the left-most path and heard a horrible noise, causing him to immediately retreat
    - Travok started down the middle path looking for traps. He found a pile of hay which he promptly poked at with his shortsword triggering a bear trap and further alerting the evil within
    - As Klug is standing ready for a fight at the mouth of the left-most path, a horrible monster quickened its pace as it rushed down the path towards the Orc
  - The fight begins!
    - Berend threw an axe, Artina created a spiritual hammer, Klug tossed a javelin all before the monster rushed down the hall and produced a shrill scream, terrifying most members of the group
    - Talon ain't all about that and, frightened, started down the right-most path instead where he encountered and quickly dispatched a skeleton
    - After the monster spit acid at Berend, Artina, and Joggy—though missing—Joggy used dissonant whispers on the fiend to a moderate effect
    - Joggy immediately turned to run away and took an immense amount of damage, with Artina thankfully healing him later on
    - Travok moved stealthily past the right fork of the middle path and barely saw the back of a skeleton in the distance. With one quick loose of the crossbow, a bolt passed directly through the back of the skull, knocking it right off
    - Berend threw an axe and hit the fiend in the calf, and a series of hammer blows (both spiritual and physical) bludgeon the fiend for more damage before Klug, in a ferocious rage, took two huge gashes out of the fiend's back
    - The fiend turned around wildly swinging and snapping at both Vondal and Klug in a rage, but as it moved to retreat into the shadows took damage simultaneously from Artina, Vondal, and Klug—killing the monster dead (presumably)
  - With no more immediate threats, the gang headed down the corridor where the monster originally came from and found a cave with piles of bones, a large collection of dead creatures, and terrible smells which caused certain folks to nearly vomit
  - Trav, returning down that middle path, saw a bit of light coming from the far end near where he murdered (if one could say that) the skeleton moments before
    - As Travok lead the way with his torch, the gang came across and entered a chamber with a very bright source of light in the middle
    - They found a pool of water at the bottom of a recessed chamber with a strange portal in the middle, surrounded by a ring of fire
    - The gang faintly heard an eerie, familiar sounding voice of a man they had broken bread with merely hours ago
