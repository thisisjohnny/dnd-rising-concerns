# Marked for Life

## In the between world
With the portal closed behind him, Travok comes face to face with the monster in the upside-down...
  - The monster reaches down to grab Travok
    - Trav tries to quickly jump out of the way, but his foot slips on the moisty mire
    - The monster picks him up with one hand that wraps all the way around Travok's arm and tosses him against the wall; Travok, however, deftly turns mid-air to brace himself against the wall to soften the blow
    - Suddenly a bloated creature from within the mire, groaning, reaches for Travok who swiftly stabs it through the head
  - Back in the right-side-up, the gang confronts Giddeon
    - The Joggy and Klug try to get Giddeon to open back up the portal to help Travok escape, but Giddeon says the portal is only opened by the master
    - Giddeon attempts to quickly run away but Klug and the gang slash at him as he moves towards Rouanna; as he falls to his knee, losing life, Rouanna kicks him in the head
    - As Giddeon breathes his last breath, the portal snaps back into being. The cave walls rumble and a strange wind seems to blow as Giddeon and the skeletons begins to slip through towards the portal
    - Klug grabs onto Giddeon's arm as he slips off the ledge. At this point, EVERYTHING—including the house itself—starts to get sucked down into the portal which is growing ever larger
    - Klug releases Giddeon hoping it may stop the dilation, but to no effect
  - Travok on the other side sees all these pieces of house, bone, dead bodies, and rushing water begin to flow through the reopened portal
    - Travok runs to get past the monster, but slips on the mire. Trying again, he easily gets knocked back towards the wall by the monster
    - Finally, Travok takes one more run at the creature and somersaults through its legs. On the other side of the monster, he veers off to the left instead of heading directly at the portal, runs and jumps off the wall
    - The monster, slightly confused by this unorthodox maneuver, takes a swing to grab the dwarf, but Trav contorts in the air and arches his back above its hand

## Right-side-up again
  - Travok launches through the portal back to the right-side-up, reappearing in the cave with the rest of the gang a little less gracefully than he entered the portal from the other side
    - Artina revives Vondal as the house more rapidly begins to fall apart and the gang—girded by Joggy's encouraging words—look for ways out
    - It appears to the gang that all the 'unnatural' elements around them are crumbling into the portal. Noticing this behavior, Vondal is able to toss a grappling hook to a stable rock above
    - Klug tosses Rouanna over his neck and follows the rest of the gang up the rope and to the top just before seeing the entire side of the house collapse in on itself
    - The party runs out the front door and feel all the rain and mist outside being pulled toward them horizontally before moving down into the portal
    - Suddenly a large crashing sound emanates from the portal and the entire house—or what's left of it—disappears and the moisture in the air immediately falls all around
  - Where it was nighttime before, the gang is now standing in the daylight in a forest—although lost—about where they expected to be
    - The other dwarves from the basement emerge from behind some trees in the forest and approach the gang, inquiring about what happened; as this happens, Klug begins to wander off into the woods looking for his brother Targ
    - Travok notices a burning pain where a rune is burned into his forearm from a ring the monster was wearing; Joggy noticed it was a demonic symbol, but it's nature and purpose are unknown
    - Able to take stock of the situation, the gang recognizes the ruins of the guest house are still there, but a quarry appears where the manor once stood
  - Joggy, Talon, and Klug go back to where the house stood to search for Targ
    - The group finds a few books, some gold pieces, and a medallion with a symbol which matches the rune burned into Travok's arm
    - Talon was able to identify a set of footprints headed north which disappear shortly after finding the carcass of a large dire wolf
    - Unable to tack the prints any farther, the gang decides to head southeast toward their destination and set up camp instead
  - Everyone takes long rests while Travok keeps watch
    - Travok, feeling the burning rune still on his arm, looks back over his shoulder and sees what appears to be a shadowy outline of Linessa in the woods which slowly fades back to where the house was
    - With dissonant whispers in his head, he also hears the monster say: "I told you, you cannot run from me"
