# Travok in Wonderland

## In the cave
Once inside the cave, the gang spread out around to fill all the little nooks and crevices... waiting...
  - The gang hears Giddeon speaking to Rouanna: "You would bear a great gift for the master" and that "Things have gone silent; surely your friends are dead."
  - Joggy and the gang take up positions around the door from where they believe they heard that conversation
    - Joggy disguises himself as Glem and walks through the door, telling Giddeon the child is dead
    - Joggy finds Rouanna in the room, mostly undressed, chained to the wall, with runes all over her body
    - Giddeon is suspicious of Joggy and Klug, who is pretending to be his brother Targ, and leads Rouanna towards the hellmouth
  - As Giddeon leads Rouanna through the door, Talon fires an arrow striking him, catching him off guard
    - Berend commands Travok to attack who lands a vicious blow to Giddeon's arm before Berend himself steps out of the shadows and landing another blow with his axe
    - Artina is able to cast hold person which arrests Giddeon completely allowing Travok to connect with another two heavy blows
    - Travok and the rest of the gang, however, notice that Giddeon doesn't appear as hurt as one ought to be given all the hits he has taken so far...
    - Vondal attacks with his warhammer, crushing Giddeon with a heavy strike while Berend swings with his magical longsword landing another hit and knocking Giddeon prone
    - Travok grabs hold of a skeleton—which appeared as the fight continued—and holds it on the ledge above the hellmouth
    - Talon looses another arrow as Giddeon stands up, striking him in the shoulder a third time
    - At this latest attack, Giddeon is able to produce a wall of fire to cut off the gang in the doorway while more skeletons appear from the various corridors around the cave
  - Travok grapples a skeleton and, rolling backwards, kick flips the skeleton into the hellmouth. Trav, then peering into the portal, hears strange whispers and—the life seemingly draining from his face—steps into the ring
  - After Klug and Talon dispatch the final skeletons, Joggy calls out down the hall at Giddeon
    - Giddeon responds: "Whether I live or die, the master will deal with you all. Soon you will all come to know him. What you have done to his child will not be forgiven."
    - He then proceeds to tell the gang that Travok, a gift the master will not be pleased with, is doomed to live in the mire and knocks Vondal completely unconscious—damn near killing him—with the mere point of his finger

## In the upside-down
  - On the other side or the portal is a cave similar to the one from whence Travok just came, except exceedingly nasty
  - The mire is filled with that nasty-ass dank when a giant monster approaches, Travok barely coming up to its knee, saying "Welcome, servant of Moradin..."
