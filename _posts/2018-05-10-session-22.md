# Hatters Gonna Hat

## The gates of Candlehall
The gang approaches the gates of Candlehall and begins to notice a dull, constant humming from a collection of apiaries
  - Candlehall is a mining and farming town with a focus on, as you might expect from the name, beekeeping for wax production
  - At the game, there is a civil confrontation as the city guard meets the group
    - The head of the guard, they notice, is the same guardsman who they skirmished with in the woods not so many nights ago
    - Travok, Talon, and many of the others are noticeably on-edge
    - During that chat, it's found that the city were looking for a band of dwarves leading around an orc and one was already arrested
    - Klug is shackled in aggreement with the gang in order to move about the city and meet with the Baroness, Katrin Hauser

## The Baroness
The gang meets with Katrin after making their way to the North end where the more wealthy residents live
  - Inside the hall, well lit with candles, Katrin extends her gratitude for the gang finding and returning Rouanna safely to her parents
    - The Baroness tells the gang she is a sort of aunt to Rouanna, having been friends with her mother for quite some time
    - The gang is understandably uneasy, having literally gone through hell to return Rouanna, when they see Rouanna being led away by the guardsmen
  - Katrin reveals that they've apprehended another orc who is currently locked away in the dungeon and awaiting execution on the morrow
  - The matter of the dwarves, however, was still unresolved; but because of their heroic actions to return Rouanna, a deal is proposed
    - Katrin presses on the gang that because the skirmish in the woods bringing such pain and suffering to the families of the guardsmen, a public showing needs to be made to arrest the gang where they will then be extradited back to the Citadel
    - Since they already have an orc in hand, and there was no mention of an elf, the arrest would be only for the dwarves
    - Everyone agrees to these terms and the gang sets back out to ensure Rouanna was safely delivered home

## Meeting Mr. Blackrock
Making their way across town, the gang approaches the house of Rouanna's upbringing
  - Trav and Joggy knock on the door; a short while later Rouanna's father appears
    - He thanks the whole group for her safe return and, after some light and good natured ball-busting, pays them a decent sum as a means of appreciation
    - Travok, looking for answers about the brand on his arm, asks if he has information
  - Blackrock points the gang towards the Rusty Dragon Inn for a place they can lay their heads for the night and unburden themselves from some of their newfound coin in the form of alcohol

## An old friend
The gang splits up to take care of some business with half of the group going shopping, and the other off to find unusual things
  - Vondal, Artina, and Berend look for a shop to gear up
    - They come across the store of a Tilbin the blacksmith where Vondal purchases a nice battle axe which he requests to be silvered overnight
    - Artina also purchases a new (normal) battle axe and is mistaken for a man
  - Joggy, Trav, Klug, and Talon head off in search of a magical item which may be able to hide Klug, and to figure out what is going on with Travok's arm
    - As they skulk about the northeast end of the city trying not to call attention to the shackled orc, they find a familiar face in the crowd
    - Sera Gerrin is haggling with a shop keep as Klug calls out to meet her, with Telva Oldsmoor not too far away
    - Talon learns that Telva's husband, Harmon, had passed away a few weeks ago from his condition as they catch up
    - Joggy coyly asks Sera if she could help with their orc situation; she sets up a plan to meet back at the Rusty Dragon Inn later that night
  - Despite not knowing herself, Sera points Travok to one of the temples in the city for help with his situation

## A religious experience (of sorts)
Joggy, Travok and the others begin to circle back around the city looking for one of the temples Sera suggested
  - The gang does come across, finally, the temple of Joaquin—the merchant god–and enter
    - As Travok speaks with one of the clerics, he shows the brand on his arm. This immediately freaks out the cleric who begins to accuse Travok as being a demon worshiper
  - They head back across town where they find the temple of Chanti, where Travok is met with pretty much the same response
  - The clerics recommend that he burn the brand off entirely

## The Rusty Dragon Inn
With the two groups more of less getting what they needed, they all return back to the Rusty Dragon Inn where Vondal, Artina, and Berend have rented rooms for the group that evening
  - While eating and drinking, Sera Gerrin and Telva walk in, followed by an unknown character who sits at a table his own
  - Sera motions to Joggy that the man is the man she had suggested earlier might help with their magic request
  - Joggy sits down at the table and speaks with Omor Graz
    - Omor produces a hat to Joggy claiming that it will help hide the wearer from sight
    - Unsure of this man and his reputation, Joggy requests to try out the hat before making a final purchase
  - Travok then walks over to sit with the man while Joggy heads upstairs to attune to the hat
    - Omor doesn't have any information that may help with Travok's brand either
    - Trav is feeling more and more that his condition may be a permanent one
  - As this is all happening, Talon notices a shifty person at the bar who appears to be following the group and keeping tabs on them
    - Berend blatantly and drunkenly yells out, "Who, that guy?" pointing to the bar
  - Joggy casts disguise self with the hat and the gang proceed with the purchase
    - Following a longer-than-necessary discussion about who, how, and how much everyone would chip in for it, Travok finally meets Omor outside to provide payment
  - With the strange character still at the bar keeping an obviously watchful eye on the dwarves, Travok heads to the bar and—acting drunker than he is—deftly removes the man's belt from his person
  - With all their business concluded for the night, the gang retires to their rooms
    - As the man keeping tabs on them stands up, his pants fall down hilariously
