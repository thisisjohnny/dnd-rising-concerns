# What Had to Be Done

## A guard returns
The boy, running towards the town center, finds a guard and returns to the scene
  - Talon explains the situation to the guard who heads to the tower to secure backup
  - Two of the guards pick up Hemrick and begin to escort him to the town hall
The crowd has actually grown in size in the town center as the rest of the gang emerges from the cistern
  - As guards begin to gather, the Baroness walks out to the square to survey the situation; along the way, she speaks with the guard captain
  - The Baroness beckons the gang inside the great hall, guards gathering up Targe to toss him into a cell
Back inside the great hall, Katrin stops inside the door waiting for the gang to gather before closing the doors
  - A clerk she spoke with in the hallway enters the room and provids the gang with a purse full of coinâ€”holding up her end of the bargain
    (2000gp!)
  - Talon entreats the Baroness for an audience with Hemrick to ascertain the nature and location for his crew's inner workings
  - Although not knowing Hemrick himself, Katrin offers more information on John Preston, a member of a gang of slavers out of Sloth? in the north
  - Talon's persistence nets the group another 500gp! but outs Klug in the process
  - Katrin confronts Klug about his brother, but agrees after a brief discussion to release Targe into the gang's chargeâ€”at the north gate, at midnight

## Back at the Rusty Dragon Inn
  - Klug buys up a couple bottles of the best middle-shelf booze in the bar and what can best be described as a soup kayak for all
  - Travok goes for a walk down the road to Teilbin's Forge to gather up some supplies
  - On the way back the two see Ovor who beckons them over, inquiring about what happened earlier in the day
  - Travok offers up sparse details about the slavers and the skirmish
  (Ovor is from far south in Kalasharad)
After a long rest, the gang gathers together in the downstairs of the inn to head out to the north gate
  - Before meeting the rest of the group downstairs, Artina focuses and prays on the symbol she took from Preston's body, recognizing it as the symbol of archdevil Asmadeus, the king of all hell
  - [PAUSE FOR ALLEGED GUNFIRE IN ERIE]
  - Travok sneaks up ahead of the group towards the guard towers and hears a conversation between the guards begrudgingly carrying out their duties
  - The guards open up the tower and release Targe to the dwarven group, looking a little worse for wear
  - Klug, Vondal, and the others drag Targe outside through the grate
Talon and Travok, hanging back under an abundance of caution, make their way out the east gate and circle back up with the rest of the gang in the woods beyond the north gate
  - Targe comes to as the gang forms back up long enough to tell Artina to fuck off
  - The dwarves all agree their next move is to follow orders and head back towards town Tarley on their way back to Citadel Hoarfrost
  - The gang arrives in town a while after the sun has come up, Klug effortlessly carrying his brother on his shoulders

## Arriving at the town of Tarley
Without a proper jail or holding cells, Klug brings his brother Targe to his shop for safekeeping
  - Klug reaches back with a large hand and slaps Targe awake
  - Klug confronts his brother about his goings on and how he found himself mixed up with the wrong people
  - He decides to set his brother off on a horse out of town later that evening and makes preparations to do so
Klug tries to rouse his brother later that night but reaches down and touches a cold, lifeless body
  - Artina: "I did what had to be done." ðŸ˜±
  - Klug: [Blood-curdling roar]
