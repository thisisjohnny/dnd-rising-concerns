# Old friends. New friends.

## After the melee
Klug drops down onto a metal bridge where his brother Targe is laying unconscious
  - The bridge begins to creak, Klug tries to rouse his brother with a few slaps, but is unable to do so
  - He gathers up his brother and tries to drag him in the direction of the fleeing baddies as the bridge collapses; they both fall 20ft into the water pooling below
Travok and Joggy begin to interrogate the bandit they captured, but don't seem to get anywhere with the uncooperative brigand
  - Both dwarves hit the bandit simultaneously knocking him unconscious again
Vondal calls down to Klug and jumps down into the cistern after him taking fall damage and nearly falling on Targe
  - Down below, Klug and Vondal look for a way out and instead find an unpleasant plant-like creature—a shambling mound
  - Before the pair truly realize what's happening, the mound reaches out, grabs Klug, and begins to consume him
  - Talon peering down into the cistern sees this plant consuming his friend and fires an arrow into the creature
  - Berend leaps down into the cistern driving his axe into the mound's back; the mound flailing wildly throws him around into the water
  - After Joggy hits the mound with dissonant whispers, Klug—still raging—makes two critical hits swinging his meat cleaver in a frenzy
  - Finally Talon finishes the mound with an arrow as Travok rolls over and shoots another crossbow bolt, this time—however—at the unconscious Targe

## Back above ground
The whole gang is back above ground as the guard captain comes over, the town square still filled with bodies and blood
  - Talon bolts off eastward to follow the bandit leader he's marked
  - The rest of the group waits as Artina says a prayer of healing
Talon tracks the bandit leader eastward to the river and up north
  - Talon catches up to Hemrick, fires an arrow above his head, and fishes him out of the water
  - Talon slowly escorts the bandit, hands raised in the air, farther north towards the guard towers
  - The bandit tries to bargain for his life with goods and gold, but Talon persists in bringing him along to the guards
Before they reach the tower, Talon fires an arrow into Hemrick's leg displeased with the progress of their conversation
  - Hemrick returns fire with a crossbow bolt through his cloak, missing Talon with his shot
  - Talon and Hemrick trade blows before another bandit who had escaped with Hemrick through the sewers flanks Talon
  - Talon deftly maneuvers out of the way was the bandit's sword swings down on top of where Talon used to be
  - With another swing from his shortsword, Talon takes out Hemrick and persuades his friend to leave immediately
Talon sends a small child off to find the guard captain as he stabilizes Hemrick
