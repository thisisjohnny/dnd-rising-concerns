# Sticks and Stones

## At the campsite
As the gang takes a rest overnight, Travok and Talon keep first watch...
  - With the burning sensation on his arm, and the demonic voices in his head, Travok attempts to slip away from the group and search for that shadowy figure of Linessa
    - Trav is able to slip away into the darkness, but Talon notices that he split the scene and rouses the others
    - Joggy and Talon begin to search the area where Travok was last seen, picking up on his trail
    - Knowing the direction Travok took, Klug and Berend join the search party as Vondal kept watch on Rouanna and the other dwarves: Theldir, Rotus, Bolkum

## Finding Travok
Despite backtracking and carefully traversing the woods, Talon is able to track Travok back to where the manor once stood
  - Travok, having climbed down the rocky face into the pool where the portal once was, kneels down in the pool of water seemingly attempting to get back into the other dimension
    - Joggy and the others call down to him from atop the ledge; Travok, holding onto the brand on his arm, tells the group what he heard and saw
  - Klug heads down into the pool to recover Travok and ushers him up the cliff face
    - Travok slips but Klug reaches out and grabs the dwarf from the collar of his cloak, swinging him back onto the cliff face
  - Now back at the camp, Joggy, Berend, and Klug keep the next watch as the rest continue their sleep
    - Travok appears to be having bad dreams, shaking and muttering under his breath while he sleeps: "Don't trust Glem"

## The road to Candlehall
With the rest of the evening passing without incident, the party splits off from Bolkum et al who are traveling back to safety with the other villagers
  - At a clearing in the woods, the gang comes across an extremely large oak tree when they suddenly hear the voice of Bolkum whom they know was heading in the opposite direction
    - Travok and Klug move over to investigate the tree; with nothing in sight, the dead branches above begin to move and climb down the trunk
    - As the tree figures hit the ground, Talon looses a triplet of arrows at the monsters
    - After a few shots are traded among the combatants, a bunch of smaller tree monsters close in on the gang from the woods
    - With the larger monsters already vanquished, the smaller treelings begin to run from the battle when they're destroyed by repeated blows from Artina, Berend, and Talon
  - After the battle, the gang finds themselves back on the road and a while later safely at the gates of Candlehall
