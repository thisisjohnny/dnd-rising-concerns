# Repercussions

## Klug's response
After Artina's choice to kill Targe, Klug has a perfectly measured response
  - Klug demands answers, but Artina merely states she was carrying out her god's will
  - Talon and other members of the town of Tarley object to her means
  - In a frenzied rage, Klug takes a swing at Artina with his cleaver
  - Berend tries to block the blow but Klug's strength is too much
  - Travok fires a crossbow bolt at Klug in defense of his cleric
  - Telva and Talon and others intervene to break up the melee
Klug walks back to his shoppe after Joggy forces him to his (super heated) cleaver
  - As Talon escorts his friend to his door, Travok hears a voice in his head: "Kill him"
  - Travok takes a swing at Talon with his shortsword and misses completely
  - Telva takes Travok aside and tells him what she saw of his future, warning him of who to trust
Sera Gerrin demands the gang gather up their belongings and leave town at daybreak

## A last night in Tarley
Before the gang turn in for their final night in Tarley, Joggy plans an intervention
  - Joggy confronts Artina about her actions where she doubles down on her reasoning
  - Berend and Travok back her up before Joggy turns his attention to Travok's role in the skirmish
  - Travok explains the voice in his head to the dwarves who reaffirm their duty to aide his recovery; Talon, however, remains unconvinced
Prior to turning in for the night, Talon takes a quick walk around the town square to clear his mind
  - While walking, Talon sees a ghostly figure of a woman with a baby gazing towards the inn before she fades back into the woods

## All's well...
  - Vondal, drunk, was hanging out with Wheel by the well the entire time

## Joggy's home
The gang come across a tradesperson along the road back to the Citadel who tells them of trouble in the town of Mooten
  - Joggy hurriedly points his noble colt down the fork in the road towards his hometown and arrives to find his home in shambles, destroyed by what appears to large giant-like creatures
  - Searching through his childhood home, Joggy finds his mother's magic wand but not much more
  - No other clues were left about the town leaving the gang to make their way back to the Citadel

## The foothills of the Shivertops
As the gang makes their way through the foothills of the Shivertops on their way to Citadel Hoarfrost, they encounter an odd group of two-headed giants
  - Vondal overhears some of the argument (simultaneously both with and among themselves), debating whether to continue towards the Citadel or retreat home
  - The gang plan an ambush as the giants confer
