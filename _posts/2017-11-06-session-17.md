# Don't Judge a Book by Its Cover

## Brotherly love
The brothers Klug and Targ share a heated discussion in Orc about why they're both there before Targ, frustrated that his brother would parter up with some dwarves, decides he's taking Klug home by force...
  - Targ spear-tackled Klug on top of Berend taking all three of them to the ground
  - Travok, in a downward motion, stabs Targ in the back sending him unconscious
  - Joggy catches up to the skirmish and seeing bodies and blood all over begins the inquisition
    - Talon quickly hurls accusations around about Targ's motives, alleging that he was the one who jailed him in the cells outside
    - The other three dwarves corroborate Talon's story, saying that when Targ brings folks into the back room, they never come back out
  - Joggy discovers another small hallway and room with a cryptic image on the front of an egg-shape and nine concentric circles
    - Travok finds the door trapped by a strange almost electric field
    - One of the dwarves tries to walk through the door, but Travok deftly grabs his beard to stop him and calm him down
  - After tempers calm down a bit, the group takes a rest before figuring out how to get past that trap

## One final(?) present from Glem
Joggy investigates the door further noticing its magical trap and strange symbols, but turn to Klug and—more specifically—his brother Targ for assistance
  - Klug restrains his brother and tries to rouse him. Despite a slap to the face and a splash of water, Targ won't wake until Vondal heals him by laying on hands
  - After finally waking, Targ mentioned that the only ones who go through the door are Giddeon and the gnome
  - Vondal and Berend go upstairs to grab Glem's body at first mention of the gnome
    - They find Glem's body is no longer at the top of the stairs, but a long blood streak heads into Giddeon's study
    - The body appears lifeless by the mantle, but is holding a plain leather book
    - Vondal picks up the book and tries to decipher its contents, but immediately feels a strange sensation of evil
    - A shadowy ghost figure appears in the dark corner of the room and charges at the twins
  - Vondal and Berend quickly dispatch the specter, but another two appear from the same corner of the room
    - A thunderous strike from Vondal alerts the rest of the party downstairs who run up and join the fight
    - After a longer than necessary skirmish, Berend is able to dispatch the second and final ghost
  - Travok picks the lock on the diary of Linessa and begins to thumb through, skimming the words of a young woman
    - She speaks about marrying into the Saltmarsh family to help her family financially
    - Her and Giddeon were tying to have a child unsuccessfully for years
    - The diary entries begin to become more sporadic and spoopy—including that she would 'loose' large chunks of time
    - The final entry details her happiness at finally being pregnant and expecting their first child
  - Talon attempts to read the evil book Glem was holding and a pulse shoots through his body leaving him temporarily deaf
  - Artina takes the book from Talon and places the book into a recess in the wall above the mantle; a slat in the mantle opens up revealing an odd necklace
    - Berend takes the necklace and put it on... Surprisingly, nothing happens
    - Artina removes the book from the wall and gives it to Joggy to carry

## Meanwhile, back downstairs
  - While the skirmish occurred upstairs, Targ mentioned to Klug that he was given an ultimatum after getting lost in the swamp: either help feed the evil downstairs or be fed to it
  - Berend takes the necklace retrieved from the mantle upstairs and places it into the egg-shaped recess in the door downstairs 'unlocking' the plate but not the door itself
    - One of the eyes on the necklace pops open and looks around at one of the lines within the circles
    - Travok begins turning the center plate to align the lines from the rings, making the mouth the nose and the eyes line up as the face begins to come back into proper shape
    - Travok pushes on the dial after the face comes back into alignment, causing it to look as though it is about to scream in agony before another plate slides in front, sealing the necklace in, and opening the door
  - Behind the door is a spiraling staircase... to what? The gang does not know
