# Repercussions

## In the Shivertops
The gang take up strategic positions as the giant-like creatures begin to investigate
  - One creature notices Joggy and Talon in the snow and moves to encounter them
  - Joggy and Talon split in opposite directions, confusing the two-headed monster causing it to fall
  - As it regains its footing, the giant smashes Talon, knocking him unconscious in a snowbank

## Sliding into view
Another even larger creature comes down from the north as the gang struggles
  - As the other giant-like creature comes into view, a new dwarf follows closely, sliding down the mountain
  - Travok leaps beautifully through the air, landing on top of the second giant—becoming more of a pest than a threat
  - Artina commands the first giant to flee from Talon's body, opening an opportunity for Joggy to save him

## A likely conclusion
The gang, bolstered by the introduction of a mysterious new brother, finish off the intruders albeit with some difficulty
  - The new dwarf, Dain, releases a critical Eldritch blast killing the largest of the three
  - Talon, worse for wear, kebabs the one creature's heads together with an arrow loosed from his longbow
  - Artina mercilessly finishes off the third and final creature after Talon produced another lethal arrow from his bow

## Home again
The gang complete the remaining several miles and finally see the walls of Citadel Hoarfrost come into view
  - A gap in the thick citadel walls and billowing smoke from the courtyard cause the gang to proceed cautiously
  - The gang make their way through to the courtyard after presenting their colors to the posted sentries
  - Sgt. Garack seeing the crew approaches them and shares the news of the attack: Garack is now acting commander of the citadel
  - Joggy—still concerned about the status of his family—asks for leave to search for them but Garack denies his request
  - Berend asks Garack if he's taken care of the bofa situation, to which Garack appoints Berend to cover bofa deez sentry shifts
