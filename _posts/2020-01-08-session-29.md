# Demon Worshiper

## An old friend
Berend is visited again by the demon child's ghost of a mother in the middle of the night
  - Standing in the corner of his chamber, the woman appeared looking towards Berend's belongings
  - After asking what she wanted, she disappeared back into the wall
  - The gang seems to find the item she was looking for, the "key" from the house, and decide to let Dain hold onto it for safekeeping

## The Brightblade Keep
The gang heads to the Brightblade Keep after breakfast being summoned by the high lord to receive their new directions and to find more information on Joggy's family who have been said to be inside the city
  - Upon arrival, the gang are led through the keep to the council's chamber with Dain and Talon—not members of the military—being left behind
  - In the chamber the gang finds Lutram Brightblade sitting in the throne surrounded by a semi-circle of other council members
  - They find out that Vondal had sent word via falcon that the Thane of the Citadel passed from his injuries sustained in the attack
  - With that falcon included documents containing the Thane's last will & testament, naming Rouanna his successor causing murmurs to break out among the rest of the council
  - Lutram gives the gang their latest orders: head west of the mountains to the North Dales to find out more about the curious incursion of Ettins
  - Joggy learns that his mother is safe and teaching magic in the Scholar's Borough area of the city
  - For fear of digging up a sketchy past, Joggy decides not to proceed with finding her; merely knowing she's safe is good enough

## Shop 'til you drop
The group heads into the market to prepare for the expectedly rough journey to the North Dales
  - Berend and Talon find out more about the potions they were able to gather in the swamp manor, though not the most helpful information
  - Joggy buys a falcon from the bestiary. His name is Steven Seagull.
  - The gang wrap up their shopping and begin to head out of town, walking through The Eights (The Split Quarter), when Travok feels steel slip into his back and a voice say "Erathis sends her regards, demon worshiper"...
