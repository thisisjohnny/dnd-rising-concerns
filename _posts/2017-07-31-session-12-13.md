# Drain the Swamp

## Back on the road to Greyport
  - As the gang got back on the road to Greyport things appeared to start out fine, but suddenly everything turned foggy and swampy. Waters rose up out of nowhere until the party could continue no further when they came across a pack of ghouls
  - Despite better judgement, Vondal 'The Woke' used Thunderstrike and roused the suspicions of even more ghouls before Travok got the rest of the party to hide in the mud—_Predator_ style—and army crawl away
  - The swamp started to clear away a bit as the party moved along towards a paved road which led up to a manor whose door was adorned with lanterns (and whose roof was adorned with spoopy gargoyles)
  - A pair of hell hounds attacked as the gang approached the manor and were quickly rebuked despite some toasty fire breath which caused Klug, especially, a spot of bother
  - When the party approached the door, Joggy disguised himself as an 18-year-old human girl, wet from the rain. Upon knocking on the door, an old—smaller than normal—gnome answered the door
    - The gnome had a dope hat
