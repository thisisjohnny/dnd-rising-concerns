# Gnomish Prankings

## Inside the manor
  - Glem is a house gnome; Giddeon, is the master of the house whose family has been there for ages. Glem mentioned the structure outside burned down some years ago
  - As soon as they enter the building, they are shocked by the visage of a horrible monster
    - It has a face like a combination of lion and man, the wings of a bat, body of a lion, and a scorpion tail
    - Other strange monsters are taxidermied around the vestibule
    - As they are led through the manor by the gnome, there appear to be portraits of generations of family members hanging on the walls. Once opulent, the house is now old, musty, and in disrepair
  - Joggy and the boys beseech Giddeon for quarter. Giddeon obliges and asks Glem to bring them some food when Joggy suddenly drops his disguise and comes clean about the gang and their origins
  - In conversation during the course of the meal, Giddeon mentions the swamp as a curse on his family. For generations his family had a successful mining operation (with the mine below the manor)
    - As Giddeon told it, at some point mists crept in, the mines dried up, and soon after the store burned down his wife passed away
  - Joggy asks Giddeon to use his crapper as a ploy to sneak around the manor to figure out what's going on, but unfortunately for him, Giddeon was able to see him down the long length of the hallway
  - At around 10:00 as dinner is wrapping up, Giddeon retires for the night while Glem takes the party upstairs to a larger room where the gang can extend their bedrolls
  - Talon headed up to the third floor of the manor with Glem upon his request while he wrote a letter for Talon to carry back to his homelands
  - After the party settled down for sleep, some time into the night (8) thugs ambushed the gang while they slept
