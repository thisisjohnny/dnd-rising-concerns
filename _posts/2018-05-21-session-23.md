# "The Tarren Hill Dwarf Gang"

## Later that night at the Rusty Dragon Inn
Talon suggests that some folks go and scope out the gallows before the night is over to gain some better intel about the area
  - Travok expresses concern over Talon's idea given that there appears to still be a hooded man outside still keeping watch on their movements
  - Trav doesn't get a good night's sleep... He starts to have dreams, or visions?, of the hands in the muck in the hellmouth, and feels paralyzed as the creature's hand reaches out
  - Travok wakes just before the hand reaches his face

## Early morning, the day of the execution
At the breakfast table Telva asks about Travok's brand and starts to sense something about it
  - She offers to help him 'take a look' needing just a drop of blood
  - Although Telva suggests they do the thing in private, Klug stabs Travok with his fork extorting an alarming scream from Trav
  - Joggy pretends to head to the latrine but follows Travok and Telva to his room

[//]: # ## Blood Magic
[//]: # Travok cuts his arm above the mark to get the ritual started
[//]: #  - Telva marks her eyeballs with the blood after rolling it between her thumb and forefinger
[//]: #  - Suddenly her eyes grow pupils and she sees mountains and fields, adventure and battles, and a family... a wife and kids
[//]: #  - She also sees a path, leading down below ground, through the muck and mire—hearing screams of the souls whose hands grab at Travok
[//]: #  - Telva said she's not sure if that even is his future; unsure where his path ends, or if it ever does end...

## Noontime at the square
As Sera and Tevla say their goodbyes, the rest of the gang head to the square a bit ahead of the scheduled time
  - The gates open and suddenly you can see the first prisoner, an orc, who the gang knows is in fact Targe
  - Another prisoner is led out, the man the gang captured back at the guard post—the Reverend John Preston
  - Travok sees a man on the roof and yells out, but the cheers and jeers from the crowd drown out his calls
  - From under the gallows, a man jumps up and puts a dagger to the throat of the headsman
  - It's Errol Bushwick and his gang!

Errol and his band rush the gallows to cut down both the cleric and the orc from their nooses
  - Errol himself rushes one of the guards out of the crowd and cuts his head clean off with one hit
  - Vondal the Woke uses Divine Smite to slaughter a highwayman with one swing of his new battle axe
  - Klug, disguised as a wood elf, starts running through the crowd in a frenzied rage, hacking right through Errol and other members of his band
  - Another group of highwaymen pop out of the sewers, protecting one of the rogues
  - John Preston, in an attempt to run away, is killed by Artina's spiritual hammer
  - However, Targe is able to make it into the cistern despite taking heavy damage from both Vondal and his brother Klug
  - With all other baddies either scattered or dead, Travok grabs the only living soul remaining and leaps off the rooftop to knock him unconscious
