# S&M: A Rude Awakening

## The fight ensues
  - Artina smashes a dude with the first hit of the battle, cracking his skull. Klug draws blood with a huge cleave. But as things start to look up, Joggy gets tied up by a thug...
  - Joggy responds by casting a huge earth tremor knocking down most everyone in the area, including other members of the gang
  - Travok, despite being knocked prone, flourishes his cloak around to dodge two attacks from a thug, then leaps off the back of a sofa, somersaulting through the air, and landing with both blades into the baddies laying on the ground killing one of them
  - Klug slices a few thugs in twain, Joggy spoke dissonant whispers so harsh it killed a man, and Berend buries his greataxe into another's head, and Artina Ghallagher'ed a few heads spewing bits of brain across the room

## Meanwhile, in the upstairs...
  - Travok deftly picks some locks and Klug barges into a room where Glem sits at a table. After taking a quick peek inside the room, Joggy and Travok hurriedly head downstairs
  - Berend drives a dragon nail between Glem's thumbnail (ðŸ˜±) and takes his dope hat from him as the rest of the gang ties up the aging gnome and carry him along as they make their way downstairs
  - Joggy and Travok making it down to the first floor notice the pedestal where that horrible monster wasâ€”presumably taxidermiedâ€”has sprung to life
    - Joggy begins to search, butâ€”as the monster turns towards the soundsâ€”dives back behind the pedestal
    - Travok, still stealthing, sneaks up on the creature and...
  - On the second floor, Klug finds a translucent woman inside one of the rooms looking out the window into the night
    - She asks if they can help her find her daughter. Turning around to face the gang, they could see her stomach looked ravaged with her translucent intestines hanging out
    - The gang slowly backs out the door. As she follows, she disappears as soon as she hits the threshold of the room
