# S&M: A Rude Awakening

## The fight ensues
  - Artina smashes a dude with the first hit of the battle, cracking his skull. Klug draws blood with a huge cleave. But as things start to look up, Joggy gets tied up by a thug...
  - Joggy responds by casting a huge earth tremor knocking down most everyone in the area, including other members of the gang
  - Travok, despite being knocked prone, flourishes his cloak around to dodge two attacks from a thug, then leaps off the back of a sofa, somersaulting through the air, and landing with both blades into the baddies laying on the ground killing one of them
  - Klug slices a few thugs in twain, Joggy spoke dissonant whispers so harsh it killed a man, and Berend burries his greataxe into another's head, and Artina Ghallagher'ed a few heads spewing bits of brain across the room

## Meanwhile, in the upstairs...
  - Travok deftly picks some locks and Klug barges into a room where Glem sits at a table
  - After taking a quick peek inside the room, Joggy and Travok hurriedly head downstairs
  - Berend drives a dragon nail between Glem's thumbnail ðŸ˜±
